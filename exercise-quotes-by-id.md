# Exercise: Allow getting quotes by ID

## Objective
Change a quote API server to allow GETting a quote according to the given ID.

The id should be given in the URL structure like this:

`/quotes/2`

## What should I start with?
You should use [OUR starting project: cyf-quotes-id-start](https://glitch.com/~cyf-quotes-id-start), NOT your own existing quote server.  This is because this project has quotes with IDs.

When you remix our starting project, immediately rename it as your own.

## Getting help

You should refer to the [official Express documentation on route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) to help you with this.

Or you can look at my [new express cheatsheet](../express-cheatsheet.md)

## When you are finished
* When you are finished (including testing), DM your URL via Slack to someone sitting next to you and they must test if your API works!
